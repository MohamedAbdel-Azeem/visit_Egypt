            <p class="intro">Egypt is a land of timeless treasures, with a history and culture that spans thousands of years. From the iconic Pyramids of Giza to the majestic temples of Luxor and Karnak,
                 Egypt's ancient ruins are a testament to the ingenuity and artistry of its people.
                Beyond its ancient wonders, Egypt also offers visitors a wealth of natural beauty. The Red Sea coast is a paradise for swimmers, snorkelers, and divers, with its crystal-clear waters and vibrant coral reefs. The Sahara Desert,
                 meanwhile, offers an unforgettable experience for those who seek adventure and solitude.
                Egypt is also a land of rich culture and traditions. 
                Visitors can experience the warmth of Egyptian hospitality firsthand by staying in a traditional Bedouin camp or visiting a local market.
                 And no trip to Egypt is complete without sampling the delicious cuisine, which is a blend of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern influences.</p>
